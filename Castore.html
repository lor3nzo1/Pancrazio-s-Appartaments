    <p><strong>Dear Guests,</strong></p>
    <p>
      We are delighted that you have chosen our apartment and we are pleased to send you some important information for your self check-in.

    <p><strong>The access to the combination lock is very simple:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>You will find the first keypad next to the gate. To be able to access, please enter the following code: <span class="highlight">202512#</span>.</li>
      <li>You will find the second keypad by the entrance door. To be able to access, please enter the same code: <span class="highlight">202512#</span>.</li>
